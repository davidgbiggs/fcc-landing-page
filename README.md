# Product Landing Page

This is a part of my FreeCodeCamp [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). It's the third project in the module. The code passes all of the tests in the [project requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page). See for yourself!
